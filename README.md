# RedditOauthConnection

Breaking my big Udacity Capstone project up in to chunks to work on some of the key aspects seperate from the main code base.

Currently my app pulls a JSON feed from the main site by just appending .json on to the end of the URL.  This project is look at doing it properly using OAUTH.

If things work OK then I will integrate it into the main project.
